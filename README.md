# Basic Network Design & Segmentation

This repo supports session #1 of my *Azure Networking Crash Course* live stream series on YouTube back in 2022:

This first session explains the basics of cloud networking (with a heavy emphasis on Azure of course) and I walk you through building a basic Azure Virtual Network (VNet) while teaching foundational concepts you need to know along the way.

You'll see how to design and implement a single VNet in Azure that secures a traditional two-tier application architecture made up of a web front-end and backend database server.

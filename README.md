# Basic Network Design & Segmentation

This repo supports session #1 of my **[Azure Networking Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etQMC2O274c)** live stream series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuoEOqepPoBrnpL5C3P6Ehg) back in **2022**.

This first session explains the basics of cloud networking (with a heavy emphasis on Azure of course) and I walk you through building a basic Azure Virtual Network (VNet) while teaching foundational concepts you need to know along the way.

You'll see how to design and implement a single VNet in Azure that secures a traditional two-tier application architecture made up of a web front-end and backend database server. Plus, you'll learn how to do remote access in a way that doesn't get you fired.
